# BullShip Agent Platform

BullShip is a decentralized platform that allows users to create and fund AI trading agents through a tokenized investment model. This platform combines the power of AI for trading with blockchain technology, providing transparency and democratized access to advanced trading strategies.

## Overview

The BullShip platform enables users to:

1. Create AI trading agents with a corresponding stock token
2. Buy and sell agent stock tokens to fund the trading activities
3. Share in the profits generated by successful agents through token value appreciation
4. Bridge tokens across chains using Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) (Not on production)

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts

The platform consists of several key smart contracts:

#### AgentMerchant.sol
The main contract that handles the creation of trading agents, stock token purchases and sales, and payment distributions. Key features include:

- Agent creation with wallet address, token name, and symbol
- Stock token purchasing with USDC
- Stock selling request commitment and fulfillment
- Price per token calculation based on USDC balance and token supply
- Cross-chain token purchase integration with CCTP (not on production yet)

#### AgentToken.sol
An ERC20 token implementation representing shares in a trading agent. Features:

- Minting new shares when users purchase stock
- Burning shares when users commit to sell
- Decimals set to 0 (each token represents a whole share)
- Ownership management (owned by the merchant contract)

#### CCTPHookWrapper (CircleMerchantWrapper.sol)
A contract that integrates with Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol to enable cross-chain operations:

- Receives and validates messages from other chains
- Processes token transfers and executes actions on the destination chain
- Integrates with the AgentMerchant contract for cross-chain purchases

### Tokenomics Model

The platform implements a supply/demand tokenomics model:

- Token price = USDC balance / (circulating token supply + sold token amount)
- As agents perform well and accumulate USDC, token value increases
- Users can sell tokens back at the current calculated price

## Key Features

### Agent Creation
Users can create trading agents with a unique wallet address, name, and token symbol. Each agent has its own stock token that investors can purchase.

### Stock Token Trading
- **Buying:** Users can purchase stock tokens with USDC, funding the agent's trading activities
- **Selling:** Users can commit to selling their tokens, which will be fulfilled by the agent with profits distributed

### Cross-Chain Functionality
The platform supports cross-chain operations using Circle's CCTP, allowing:
- Token purchases across different blockchains
- Seamless integration with multiple networks

### Profit Distribution
When an agent performs well, the value of its stock tokens increases proportionally to its USDC balance. When users sell tokens, they receive payment based on the current price calculation.

## Development Status

The platform is currently in development with:
- Main contracts implemented and tested
- CCTP wrapper integration for cross-chain functionality (testnet ready)
- Future mainnet deployment planned

## Technical Integration

The platform uses:
- Solidity smart contracts deployed on EVM-compatible chains
- Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol for cross-chain operations
- USDC as the base currency for all transactions
- OpenZeppelin contracts for standard implementations

## Getting Started

To interact with the BullShip platform:

1. Connect to the deployed contracts on the target blockchain
2. Create an agent by providing wallet address, name, and token symbol
3. Purchase stock tokens with USDC to fund the agent
4. Monitor agent performance and sell tokens when desired
